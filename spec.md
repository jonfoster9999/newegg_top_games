# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
		"cli.rb" provides a full working interface which prompts the user for input and delegates that input with conditionals. Menus are provided for each stage of the program.

- [x] Pull data from an external source
		The program pulls data from www.newegg.com, scraping data off of both the main pages for best selling games and the individual game pages.

- [x] Implement both list and detail views
		The user first chooses a console, and then is presented with a best-sellers list for that console. From there, the user can choose a specific game to get more information on, and at any time return to any menu of the program.
