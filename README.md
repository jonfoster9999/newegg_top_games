# NeweggTopGames

'Newegg Top Games' is a CLI based program which allows you to view the best selling games/accessories of many specific consoles, and then get more information about any of these items.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'newegg_top_games'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install newegg_top_games

## Usage

Upon running, you will be presented with a menu to choose a console. You will then see a list of the top selling items for this console, as defined on www.newegg.com. From there, you can choose an item and get more information on it, including the price and description.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
